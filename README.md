# Word Frequency for LINE Messages
There are two different versions

1. wordFreq.cpp

This is the regular one. Uses some harder things. Runs faster


2. wordFreq_Arrays.cpp

This is the easier one. Uses parallel arrays instead of maps. Only hard thing should be the Quicksort stuff but that's an easy google.





Just make sure to edit the defines at the beginning to change names and other words you don't want

Also if you want to change the input and output files you can just change the defines for that. If you change it to not an xls file then you'd need to change a few other things.

Alsooo you'll probably get an error if you open the output xls file if you use the new excel. Don't worry about that and open it anyways.

There are also some lovely bugs that I am lazy to fix :^)
